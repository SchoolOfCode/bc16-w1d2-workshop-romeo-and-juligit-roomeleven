Lights shine on Romeo who is centre stage.
Juliett enters stage left
They both quickly decide the other is very ugly.
"who ist thou foul maiden" says Romeo
"pot calling the kettle black you foul beast" retorted Juliet
Romeo starts a dance off
He drops to the floor with a sweet knee slide
Spinning around furiously around on the floor Juliett watches in awe
Suddenly she decides he is the most handsome man to ever exist
